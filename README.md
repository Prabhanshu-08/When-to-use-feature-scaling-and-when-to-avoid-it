# When-to-use-feature-scaling-and-when-to-avoid-it

[Feature scaling](https://medium.com/@prabhanshugupta008/the-scaling-decision-factors-to-consider-before-expanding-your-business-a88744a137e8) is a technique used to adjust the range and distribution of features in a dataset so that they can be more easily compared and used by machine learning algorithms. However, feature scaling is not always necessary and can sometimes even harm the performance of a model. Therefore, it is important to understand when to use feature scaling and when not to get the best results from your machine learning model. The blog could provide information on the situations in which feature scaling is necessary, how to perform feature scaling and best practices for using feature scaling in data preprocessing. Later we will see some algorithms and their performance with and without feature scaling. More details on when to apply feature scaling can be found [here](https://medium.com/@prabhanshugupta008/the-scaling-decision-factors-to-consider-before-expanding-your-business-a88744a137e8).
